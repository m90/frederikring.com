    "summary": "I'm a trained animator and film/video editor (film school, yes...), but someday decided I'd rather be writing code than attend yet another film festival. I will find getting things done right now much more tempting than talking about what might happen at some point in the future.I'm a firm believer in writing maintanable, testable and clean code, as I think it is the most important - and underrated - user facing feature. Users deserve software which is able to evolve quickly and without breakage.When I am writing software, transfering this idea is mostly about language. Programming is related to English literature as much as it is to Math. Which is a pretty awesome mix actually.",
