I'm a **freelance software engineer with more than 15 years of professional experience**, based in Berlin.

Noone should waste time on guessing, so I write boring code and create exciting documentation for your projects. [Get in touch](mailto:frederik.ring@posteo.de) if this sounds like what you or your organization need right now.

### What I can help you with

Depending on your requirements, I am able to work with a wide range of technologies, including:

- **Languages**:  JavaScript, Golang, Python, PHP
- **Frameworks & Languages**: Node.js, Go standard library, Django, Flask, Express.js, Laravel
- **Cloud & infrastructure**: AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, Serverless, Docker Swarm

Not sure what any of this means? That’s okay. I can also help you figure out which technologies best fit your needs.

### Why work with me?

I believe great software is simple and built with care. That might mean deploying an off-the-shelf solution, crafting something custom to your needs, or simply being honest about what won’t work. My goal is to provide you with software that is just as unique as yourself.

As part of [offen.software](https://www.offen.software) I also regularly publish and maintain [Open Source software](https://github.com/offen), for example [docker-volume-backup](https://github.com/offen/docker-volume-backup) or write about topics like [software versioning](https://www.offen.dev/blog/untold-roads-versioning-early-stage-software/) or [technical aspects of data privacy](https://www.offen.dev/blog/privacy-cookies/).
