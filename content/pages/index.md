I'm a **freelance software engineer with more than 15 years of professional experience**, based in Berlin.

Noone should waste time on guessing, so I write boring code and create exciting documentation for your projects.
[Get in touch](mailto:frederik.ring@posteo.de) if this sounds like what you or your organization need right now.

## What I can help you with

I’ve worked across almost every area of web development.
No matter if you're looking for a **static website**, a **webapp** based on common frameworks or a complex and custom **cloud solution**, I can help you make sense of it and deliver what's needed.
Depending on your project's requirements, I am able to work with a wide range of technologies, including:

- **Languages**:  JavaScript, Golang, Python, PHP
- **Frameworks & Languages**: Node.js, Go standard library, Django, Flask, Express.js, Laravel
- **Cloud & infrastructure**: AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, Serverless, Docker Swarm

Not sure what any of this means?
That’s okay.
I can also help you figure out which technologies best fit your needs.

## Why work with me?

Great software is simple and built with care.
That might mean deploying an off-the-shelf solution, crafting something custom to your needs, or simply being honest about what won’t work.
My goal is to provide you with **software that is as unique as yourself**.
